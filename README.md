# SwiftConcurrency

Alright let's start using async and await! In this video we take a look at the 3 main ways to write asynchronous code in Swift. We will download an image using:
(1) @escaping closures
(2) Combine
(3) Async / Await

By writing out these three techniques side-by-side, it becomes much easier to understand the progression of the Swift language and just how ~awesome~ Swift Concurrency is. We are JUST getting started!
